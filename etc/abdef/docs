gpio
=================

RAZ = read as zero
WI = write ignored
any undefined bits are RAZ/WI
any undefined registers will error out

addr	R/W	initial	name

0	R	?	GPIO_IN
	current value of all the GPIO pins (input and output)

10	R/W	0	GPIO_OUT
	output values

14	RAZ/W	0	GPIO_OUT_SET
18	RAZ/W	0	GPIO_OUT_CLR
	writing a value V will set/clear any bits that are set in V in GPIO_OUT

20	R/W	-1	GPIO_TRI
	if a bit is 1, the corresponding pin is an input

24	RAZ/W	0	GPIO_TRI_SET
28	RAZ/W	0	GPIO_TRI_CLR
	writing a value V will set/clear any bits that are set in V in GPIO_TRI

i2c
===================
this module has two registers mapped to the same address

100	W		I2C
	writing to this register causes a byte to be transferred via I2C
	writes are ignored if the i2c module is busy
	bit 7-0: write data (ignored for read)
	bit 8: set for read, cleared for write
	bit 15-9: 7-bit I2C address
	bit 16: set if the bus is to return to idle after this byte is transferred

100	R		I2C
	bit 7-0: read data if the last transfer completed and was a read, else garbage
	bit 8: set if the transfer failed. only valid if the transfer completed.
	bit 9: set if the module is still busy.

led
===================
200	R/W	0	LED
	bit 5-0 correspond to the six LEDs on the board
